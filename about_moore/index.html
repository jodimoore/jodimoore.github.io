<p>I have been doing a lot of new things lately to help me in my new career. One of the first things is learning to code. I am nowhere near good yet, but I have at least achieved my goal of demystifying the concept. Yay!</p>
<h3>Some of the things I learned are:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>how to create a webpage</li>
  <li>how to add text using html</li>
  <li>how to add style using css</li>
</ul>
